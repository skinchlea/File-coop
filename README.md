#filecoop

A file-management and messaging website.

Users can create hubs, store files and message other people in that hub.

Upload a file, share that file, and then comment on a board connected to that file.

Allows users to upload files, create folders, send invitations and messages to each other with no refreshes - all done via AJAX and PHP. Also lets users download the files.

Features a fully functional login/sign up system with password encryption. All PHP queries use prepared statements to keep the database safe.

Files can be moved from folder to folder via drag and drop.

Mobile responsive with a clean design.
